# Implementation ideas

### 3.1        Image recognition \(Camera system\)

#### 3.1.1        Idea

This idea is based on a real-time application, a camera system and an infrared sensor technology. This real-time application monitors the availability of products on the shelf and sends alerts to the store manager if products are missing or misplaced.

Sensors are placed on top of the shelf. Cameras register the customer's interactions with the shelves and transfer the live frames to an image processing software, which analyses the frames and determines which products have been removed.

#### 3.1.2        Advantages

* Exact space recording of the missing products
* Detection of wrongly placed products

#### 3.1.3        Disad The complexity of the implementation is high

* High costs
* Every camera needs a lot of computing power for real-time analysis
* Constant adaptation of software due to new products
* Customers are constantly monitored and tracked by cameras, face recognition         algorithms can be used

#### 3.1.4        Evaluation

The effort and costs for implementing this idea would be significantly high compared to the other ideas. However, the benefit of this idea is clearly high, but private customer data can be misused.

### 3.2        Button on the shelf

#### 3.2.1        Idea

A button is attached to each shelf space to be pressed by the customer when the stock of the product is low or exhausted. When pressed, a message is sent to the system. From a certain number of messages for a product, an employee is informed to replenish the shelf.

#### 3.2.2        Advantages

* Technical implementation is simple. No complicated, expensive technologies necessary.
* Implementation of buttons with WLAN and battery would be conceivable. No cabling necessary.
* Customers are actively involved. Possibly improves the shopping experience.

#### 3.2.3        Disadvantages

* Danger of spam. Customers could press the buttons for fun.
* Buttons must be powered and connected to the network. WLAN would be possible.
* Costs for buttons at each shelf space and, if necessary, cabling.
* No fixed shelf locations for the products.
* Customers may not assist this idea. Probably they won't press the button until the stock is completely used up.
* Customers may press button too early as they are unable to assess whether inventory is critical or sufficient.

#### 3.2.4        Evaluation

The effort and cost of implementing this idea would be significantly lower compared to the other ideas. However, the benefit of this idea is much less and possibly not given at all, since the help of the customers is a compelling prerequisite.

### 3.3         Weight sensors under shelf space

#### 3.3.1        Idea

At each shelf space a weight sensor is placed, which monitors the weight of the shelf periodically. If the weight of the shelf falls below a parameterizable value, the system sends a message to the store manager.

These sensors can measure the weight and determine the space of the product based on pressure values, so that the backend software can calculate the amount of products still placed on the shelf.

#### 3.3.2        Advantages

* Low complexity

#### 3.3.3        Disadvantages

* Low flexibility \(constant parameterization of the system\)
* High costs
* Maintenance costs are high
* Low reliability, if the product is too light, the weight sensor may not detect it at all.
* High test effort
* High energy consumption  
* Incorrectly placed products cannot be detected

#### 3.3.4        Evaluation

This idea is not cost-effective because of additional hardware, high energy consumption and constant maintenance of the system. In addition, the system does not cover important functions, such as detection of incorrectly placed products.

### 3.4        Check stock changes and POS system records

#### 3.4.1        Idea

Employees scan which products they take from the warehouse or put on the shelf. In cooperation with the POS system, an application can calculate the current level of a product at any time based on the number of products sold.

#### 3.4.2        Advantages

* Low cost implementation possible. No additional hardware on shelves necessary.
* The system/shelf does not need to know which product it contains. This allows flexible article placement.

#### 3.4.3        Disadvantages

* Processes have to be adapted.
* Articles may no longer be mixed on fully packed pallets. All products must be accessible to warehouse staff. This leads to increased space requirements in the warehouse.
* Products removed from the warehouse must always be registered in the merchandise management system. Too much effort? Count every product? Only allow standard sizes?
* Items in the shopping cart can cause problems at peak times because the system does not recognize that they are no longer on the shelf. Solution: Since the level of each product is known, products with high demand and low levels can be refilled before peak times. The maximum level should be sufficient to cover the delayed update of the system.

#### 3.4.4        Evaluation

This idea is very cost-effective, as little additional hardware is required and the shelves do not have to be specially converted or restructured. It is therefore probably the best approch to implement OOS detection in existing markets. However, the process of clearing out must be restructured, which requires an adjustment of product delivery and storage.

### 3.5        Automatic filling system

#### 3.5.1        Idea

#### 3.5.2        Advantages

#### 3.5.3        Disadvantages

* High costs
* Fundamental restructuring and reorganisation necessary.

#### 3.5.4        Evaluation

Considering this approach, it is only worthwhile in new markets where the necessary  structure can be planed in advance.

### 3.6        Light barrier – Detects handle on shelf

#### 3.6.1        Idea

#### 3.6.2        Advantages

#### 3.6.3        Disadvantages

#### 3.6.4        Evaluation

### 3.7         Radio Frequency \(RF\) and Infrared \(IR\) - Detects missing products

#### 3.7.1        Idea

This technology is called Wireless Sensor Network \(WSN\) and consists of spatially distributed autonomous sensors, Control Gear and RF cards. Several different RF cards can be installed within a point of sale. Each card can manage up to 200 sensors. The identification system locates a specific object by generating identification signals with a specific frequency that are reflected from the target object. Each reflected signal is measured by sensors and assigned to a specific product. The system calculates a threshold value from the information obtained from the reflected signal and detects out of stock depending on this value.

#### 3.7.2        Advantages

* Low cost 
* Low installation effort
* Access is via a central monitor
* Automatic data acquisition
* Highly scalable system

#### 3.7.3        Disadvantages

* Limited battery power
* Limited memory
* Low computational power
* System configuration is difficult
* Less secure because hackers can enter an access point and read important data
* Limited bandwidth for communication

#### 3.7.4        Evaluation

The effort and cost of implementing this idea would be significantly lower compared to the other ideas. However, the benefits of this idea are much smaller due to limited battery power and technical difficulties that may occur later.

### 3.9        RFID

#### 3.9.1        Idea

Each product \(or packaging\) is equipped with an RFID tag. RFID scanners are installed on the shelves, which recognize at any time how many products are still on the shelf. Numerous other services can be implemented by using RFID technology.

The use of RFID tags increases product availability and eliminates OOS. A stationary RFID reader can track product movements and employees can pick up products on the shelf every day with mobile readers. This allows products to be counted on the shelves and empty shelves to be refilled immediately.

#### 3.9.2        Advantages

·       Trust

·       Several product data are recorded simultaneously by a reader within a large range

·       Real-time

·       Accurate recording

·       Traceability

·       Customer requirements are ensured by increasing product availability

·       Data about product manufacture and movements can be stored

·       Basis for numerous other services

#### 3.9.3        Disadvantages

·       Implementation of RFID solutions is very expensive

·       Data protection problem due to product traceability \(customer information\)

·       Data cannot be read correctly due to malfunctions caused by liquid products.

#### 3.9.4        Evaluation

RFID technology offers a solution to reduce OOS problems. Due to high costs, RFID systems are to be installed accompanied by simultaneous process optimization at minimal cost.

### 3.10   Algorithms to compute OOS time

#### 3.10.1    Idea

Using data mining techniques, a model is developed that uses sales figures and additional data to predict when a shelf will be empty.

#### 3.10.2    Advantages

·       Staff intuition is adapted and supported by a more precise algorithm.

·       Cost-effective implementation if \(!\) the required data is already recorded by a system.

#### 3.10.3    Disadvantages

·       No fixed replenishment times \(CHECK\), missing information transfer. Prediction model has no information about the last replenishment time of a product and therefore cannot calculate a time.

·       The current shelf capacity for a product must always be transferred to the system as a parameter.

·       The prediction model must be trained with a lot of data from the past to make precise predictions. Although the sales figures can be automatically transferred to the database, influences such as empty shelves or different shelf locations with different capacities for the same product are ignored due to the lack of a management system, which results in inaccuracies.

#### 3.10.4    Evaluation

Only one prediction model makes not much sense, as additional data or data acquisition systems must already be available for its implementation, which would then also enable the implementation of a more reliable OOS detection. However, if a system is available that provides the required data basis, the prediction model would be a good addition**.**
