## RFID Usage

**Misplacement alarm:** Using RFID tags on the products and readers on the shelves, incorrectly placed products can be automatically detected and reported to employees. \(Sini Syrjälä, 2012\)

**Exceeding of the BBD:** RFID tags on the products and readers on the shelves \(or at the checkout\) allow expired food to be tracked down in the market. In addition, it enables the implementation of smart fridges that warn customers about expired foods. \(Sini Syrjälä, 2012\)

**Theft protection and analysis:** Hidden or hard-to-remove RFID tags on the products can serve as additional theft protection if appropriate readers are attached to the checkouts/exits. In addition, theft can be better analyzed because it is possible to examine where a product was last scanned. For example, you can see whether an item has not even left the warehouse and must therefore have been stolen by an employee. \(Sini Syrjälä, 2012\)

**Investigation of purchasing behaviour:** RFID tags on the products and readers on the shelves can be used to determine which products are purchased directly and which are frequently put back at a later time. RFID readers in the shopping trolley could also be used to analyse whether a returned product has been replaced by another. \(Sini Syrjälä, 2012\)

**Additional product information:** RFID tags on the products can provide the customer with additional information that can be read either directly in the store or at home. Additional services for smart refrigerators or kitchen stations are also conceivable. \(Sini Syrjälä, 2012\)

**Additional recommendations:** The customer places a product with RFID tag in his smart shopping cart. He shows him a message on a display "By buying this product you get the product xyz for half price".
