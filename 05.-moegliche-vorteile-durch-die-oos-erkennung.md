# Possible advantages

**Increase of productivity / staff savings:** A suitable system can save time in the replenishment process, as the employees can fill the corresponding products at the optimum time. This increases the productivity of the employees, because they can be used for other activities in the meantime. Alternatively, itâ€™s possible to pare down personnel.

**Decrease the loss of customers and turnover:** If the system works correctly, a product available in the warehouse will not miss in the shelf at all or only for a short time. The cases in which a customer does not receive a product because it is in the warehouse but not available for him on the shelf can thus be significantly minimized. This results in higher customer satisfaction, which goes hand in hand with the avoidance of customer and sales losses.

**Reduction of shelf stocks:** A suitable system allows the level of a shelf to be monitored at all times. This means that it can be significantly reduced, since less safety stock is required. This results in the advantage that the sales area can be better used, which enables new products to be added to the product range.

In return the shelves have to be refilled more frequently, which results in higher employee costs. \(Fleisch & Michahelles, 2007, p. 152\)

**Influencing the optimum filling levle:** By knowing the level of the shelf at all times \(depending on the technology used\), storage and ordering processes can be optimized. In addition, some products sell better if they appear to be available in small quantities. Thanks to a suitable system, the filling level on the shelf can always be kept low. In return the shelves have to be refilled more frequently, which results in higher employee costs. \(Fleisch & Michahelles, 2007, p. 152\) **Support for inventory:** Products on the shelf do not have to be counted by hand, but by support of the system.
